# solved using recurrsion
## case  1
if the number went down two  1 then it is divisible by two
​
## case 2
if remainder of a number divided by two
is not zero then it is not divisible by two
​
## case 3
if the number is not one and
not zero and it remainder is zero means its divisible
by two check the number all the way down to 1 using recurrsion
